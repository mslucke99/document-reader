# document-scanner

# Description

This project is a prototype that attempts to improve on existing document readers for the blind. We have several goals for this including allowing it to automatically detect the alignment of a document and tell the user where it needs to be moved so the camera can see it, detecting sections of a document, summarizing a document and a full speech-based interface.
